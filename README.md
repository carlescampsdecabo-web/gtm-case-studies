# GTM Case Studies
Real-world go-to-market case studies from enterprise SaaS and tech environments.

This repository documents how I’ve built, fixed, or scaled GTM motions in practice.
Each case focuses on context, decisions, execution, and outcomes — not theory.

## Case Study 1: Building an enterprise GTM motion from zero (Dots.eco)

### Context
Dots.eco was entering enterprise sales with:
- no defined enterprise ICP
- no outbound motion
- no forecast discipline
- no repeatable GTM process

The challenge was to create an enterprise motion from scratch while closing revenue in parallel.

### What I did
- Defined a narrow enterprise ICP based on buying triggers, not company size
- Built a structured discovery framework (MEDDPICC-based, signal-driven)
- Rebuilt outbound with hypothesis-led messaging and BDR support
- Introduced deal reviews and forecast hygiene
- Opened an initial partner channel to extend reach

### Outcome
- €0.8M annualized pipeline in year one
- 90% net-new business
- Consistent €60–80K enterprise deal sizes
- First enterprise deals closed in under 30 days
- Predictable pipeline and improved win-rate

## Case Study 2: Opening a new market (Mailjet – Iberia & LATAM)

### Context
Mailjet wanted to scale enterprise revenue in Iberia and LATAM with limited local presence.

### What I did
- Opened and structured the regional GTM motion
- Built enterprise pipeline via outbound and partnerships
- Recruited and led a local sales team
- Aligned Sales, Marketing, and CS around enterprise accounts

### Outcome
- 222% quota attainment as Country Manager
- Largest enterprise deal: €250K
- Signed strategic logos (La Liga, Inditex, Securitas Direct)
- Built a scalable regional revenue engine

## Case Study 3: Scaling enterprise accounts & expansion (Tree-Nation)

### Context
Tree-Nation had strong inbound traction but limited structure for enterprise expansion and retention.

### What I did
- Took ownership of a €1M ARR enterprise portfolio
- Introduced structured account planning and expansion strategy
- Worked closely with CS and Product to drive upsell opportunities
- Automated parts of customer engagement using APIs and AI workflows

### Outcome
- 114% quota attainment
- Largest enterprise contract: €220K
- Doubled annual revenue
- Expanded global enterprise accounts (Audi, Siemens, Teradata)

## Case Study 4: Market entry under ambiguity (Eliq)

### Context
Eliq needed to test and open the Iberian market quickly under strategic uncertainty.

### What I did
- Established the local GTM approach
- Built the first enterprise pipeline from outbound
- Engaged C-level stakeholders in energy and utilities
- Fed market feedback directly into leadership decisions

### Outcome
- First enterprise deals closed
- Clear ICP and positioning validated
- Market learnings delivered despite later restructuring

## Patterns across all cases

- GTM starts narrow, then scales
- Discovery beats pitching
- Structure increases speed, not bureaucracy
- Enterprise GTM is a team sport
- Forecasting improves only when deals are truly understood

---

## Why this matters
These case studies reflect how I operate:
- Hands-on
- Low ego, high ownership
- Data-informed, but customer-led
- Comfortable building in ambiguity

GTM is built through execution, not slides.
